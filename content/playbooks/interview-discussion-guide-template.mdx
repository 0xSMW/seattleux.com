# Interview discussion guide template

## Session setup (2–3 min)

- Consent + recording
- What we’ll cover
- Reminder: we’re evaluating the experience, not the person

## Warm-up

- Tell me about your role and responsibilities.
- What does “a good day” look like for this work?

## Current workflow

- Walk me through the last time you did X.
- What tools did you use?
- What went well? What was frustrating?

## Deep dive prompts

- What made that hard?
- What did you try next?
- What would you change if you could?

## Wrap-up

- If you had a magic wand, what would you fix first?
- Anything else we didn’t cover?
