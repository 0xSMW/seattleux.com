# Content (MDX)

This site uses MDX files under `content/` as the source of truth for:
- Directory listings (firms, companies)
- Guides and playbooks
- Events and groups

## Adding content

- Start from a template in `content/_templates/`
- Use a filename slug, e.g. `content/firms/example-agency.mdx`
- Keep descriptions neutral and factual
- Set `lastVerified` to the date you confirmed links/info

## Folders

- `content/firms` — firm and agency listings
- `content/companies` — company UX team listings
- `content/guides` — best-practice articles
- `content/playbooks` — templates and checklists
- `content/events` — community events
- `content/groups` — ongoing groups/meetups

## Slugs

- The slug is the filename without `.mdx`
- Keep slugs lowercase with hyphens: `some-agency-name`
