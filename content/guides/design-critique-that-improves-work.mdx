# Design critique that improves work (and team culture)

## A critique is for decisions

The goal isn’t “more feedback” — it’s better decisions. Make the decision explicit:

- What are we deciding today?
- What constraints apply?
- What are the success criteria?

## A simple critique structure

1. **Presenter frames the context** (2 minutes)
2. **Clarifying questions** (5 minutes)
3. **Feedback by criteria** (10–15 minutes)
4. **Decision + next steps** (3 minutes)

## Useful feedback prompts

- What problem does this solve?
- What assumptions does it make?
- What would break in edge cases?
- What’s the smallest change that improves clarity?

## Common pitfalls

- Jumping to solutions without understanding goals
- Feedback that’s about style preferences
- No decision captured at the end
