# Measuring UX impact without misleading yourself

## The problem

Teams often choose metrics that are easy to track but hard to interpret (e.g. time on task without context).

## A practical metric stack

Use a small set that covers:

- **Adoption:** do people start the flow?
- **Completion:** do they finish?
- **Quality:** do they succeed without errors or rework?
- **Satisfaction:** do they feel confident?

## Good measurement habits

- Establish a baseline before changes
- Pair quantitative metrics with a small amount of qualitative insight
- Watch for tradeoffs (speed vs accuracy)

## Common pitfalls

- Measuring “engagement” when the goal is efficiency
- Ignoring segment differences (new vs experienced users)
- Declaring wins without controlling for seasonality or feature rollout overlap
