# Running effective stakeholder interviews

## Who this is for

Researchers, designers, and PMs who need alignment on problems, constraints, and success criteria.

## The problem

Stakeholder interviews often turn into opinion collection. The outcome is a long list of “nice-to-haves” rather than a shared understanding of:

- what decisions the team must make
- what success looks like
- what constraints are real vs assumed

## A practical approach

1. **Define the decision you’re informing.** “What should we build?” is too broad. Narrow it.
2. **Bring a one-page brief.** Include: product context, known constraints, target users, and the decision.
3. **Use a consistent question set.** Ask the same core questions to everyone to compare answers.
4. **Separate goals from solutions.** When you hear a solution, ask: “What problem is that solving?”
5. **End with a recap.** Repeat back top problems, risks, and what you’ll do next.

## Suggested questions

- What outcomes matter most this quarter?
- What user pain do you hear most often?
- What would make this initiative a failure?
- What constraints are non-negotiable (legal, brand, platform, timing)?
- What decisions are you hoping this work will unlock?

## Common pitfalls

- Interviewing only leadership (missing frontline reality).
- Overweighting the loudest voice.
- Treating “preferences” as requirements.

## Seattle context

Seattle teams often span time zones. Consider two shorter sessions (30–45 minutes) instead of one long one to reduce meeting fatigue and improve attendance.
