# UX career growth in Seattle

## A useful way to think about growth

Growth is usually a mix of:

- **scope** (bigger, riskier problems)
- **impact** (outcomes you drive)
- **influence** (how you align teams)

## Practical steps

- Choose 1–2 skill themes per quarter (e.g. research rigor, systems thinking)
- Update your portfolio around outcomes and decisions, not artifacts
- Practice communicating tradeoffs clearly (what you chose and why)

## Community-based learning

- Join critique groups or study circles
- Share work-in-progress and ask for feedback early
- Volunteer to run a workshop or lightning talk

## Common pitfalls

- Collecting new tools instead of building depth
- Over-optimizing the portfolio for aesthetics vs decision-making
- Waiting for “permission” to lead
