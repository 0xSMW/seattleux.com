# Designing forms and error states that reduce support load

## Principles

- Prevent errors where possible
- Make errors specific and recoverable
- Preserve user input

## Practical patterns

- Use inline validation for clear constraints (e.g. password rules)
- Prefer examples over long instructions
- Put error messages next to the field, not only at the top
- Keep error language blame-free and action-oriented

## A useful error message template

- What went wrong
- Why it happened (optional)
- How to fix it
- What happens if you don’t

## Common pitfalls

- Red text with no explanation
- Clearing the form on submit failure
- Generic “Something went wrong” for user-fixable issues
