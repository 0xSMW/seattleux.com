# Recruiting participants in the Seattle area (and remotely)

## Goals

- Recruit the right participants quickly
- Minimize bias
- Avoid no-shows and scheduling chaos

## A practical recruiting flow

1. **Define inclusion/exclusion criteria.** Keep it short.
2. **Write a screener that doesn’t “teach” the answers.**
3. **Pick incentive ranges.** Align to effort and audience.
4. **Use a scheduling tool.** Remove back-and-forth.
5. **Confirm twice.** Once at scheduling, once 24 hours before.

## Sources (mix them)

- Existing customers (with care to avoid over-representing power users)
- Intercepts in-product (short, targeted)
- Panels (fast, but validate quality)
- Community outreach (great for niche topics; verify fit)

## Common pitfalls

- Over-indexing on convenience sampling.
- Recruiting only people who “love the product”.
- Using incentives that bias toward professional participants.

## Seattle context

If you’re doing in-person sessions, plan for commute variability and offer hybrid options when possible.
