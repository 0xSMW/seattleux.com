# Choosing the right usability testing method

## Start with the decision

Different decisions need different evidence. Before you pick a method, define:

- what you’re trying to decide
- how risky it is to be wrong
- how much time you have

## Quick method guide

### Moderated remote

Best for: complex workflows, probing “why”, early concepts.

### Unmoderated remote

Best for: quick iteration, broad directional feedback, simple tasks.

### In-person

Best for: physical products, high-touch environments, when rapport matters.

### Guerrilla / hallway

Best for: early UX checks, language clarity, navigation sanity checks.

## Common pitfalls

- Unmoderated tests for complex tasks (results become noisy).
- Too many tasks per session (fatigue).
- Treating “time on task” as a success metric without context.
