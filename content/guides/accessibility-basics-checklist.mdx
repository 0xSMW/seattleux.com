# Accessibility basics for product teams

## The baseline

Accessibility is a product quality practice. Start with these behaviors:

- Use semantic HTML (buttons for actions, links for navigation)
- Maintain adequate color contrast
- Ensure keyboard navigation works end-to-end
- Provide visible focus styles
- Add labels and accessible names to inputs and controls

## A quick checklist

- Can you complete key flows using only a keyboard?
- Are focus states always visible?
- Do form errors explain what to fix and how?
- Do icons have text alternatives (or `aria-hidden` when decorative)?
- Are headings structured (H1 → H2 → H3)?

## Common pitfalls

- Relying on color alone to convey state.
- Disabling focus outlines without adding replacements.
- Non-semantic clickable divs.
