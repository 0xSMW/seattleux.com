# Writing UX copy that reduces friction

## Start with intent

Before you write, define:

- what the user is trying to do
- what might confuse them
- what the system needs from them

## Practical patterns

- Use verbs for actions (“Save changes”, “Create project”)
- Prefer plain language over internal terminology
- Write error messages that explain recovery
- Keep labels consistent across the product

## Common pitfalls

- Using clever wording that reduces clarity
- Buttons that don’t describe outcomes (“Continue” everywhere)
- Error messages that blame the user
