# Running workshops that drive decisions (not just alignment)

## The workshop is for a decision

Define a decision statement:

- “We will choose X by the end of this session.”

## A practical agenda

1. **Context (10 min):** what we know, what we don’t
2. **Evidence review (15 min):** data, user insight, constraints
3. **Diverge (15 min):** generate options
4. **Converge (20 min):** evaluate by criteria
5. **Decide (10 min):** pick an option + next steps

## Facilitation tips

- Use timeboxes
- Assign roles (facilitator, scribe, decision maker)
- Capture decisions immediately (doc or ticket)

## Common pitfalls

- No decision owner in the room
- Too many objectives
- Ending without follow-through
