# Getting design systems adopted (governance + collaboration)

## The adoption principle

Teams adopt what reduces effort and risk. A design system should make the “right” path the easiest path.

## Practical governance

- Define ownership (who decides, who maintains)
- Provide a contribution process (how teams request changes)
- Set release cadence (so updates are predictable)

## Make it easy to use

- Provide starter templates
- Document “when to use” patterns
- Offer migration guidance for legacy UI

## Common pitfalls

- Shipping components without usage guidance
- No feedback loop from product teams
- Trying to standardize everything at once
