# Information architecture fundamentals for product teams

## Start with the objects

List the core objects in your system (e.g. projects, invoices, users) and clarify:

- relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- ownership and permissions
- lifecycle states

## Use mental model mapping

Before you finalize navigation, map:

- what users call things
- how they group concepts
- how they expect to find actions

## Keep navigation stable

- Keep top-level nav meaning consistent
- Avoid moving items frequently (it breaks learned behavior)
- Use clear breadcrumbs when depth grows

## Common pitfalls

- Navigation based on org structure instead of user goals
- Duplicated items with slightly different names
- Too many “misc” buckets
