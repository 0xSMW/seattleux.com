# Designing for enterprise workflows (common UX traps)

## Common enterprise realities

- Users have roles, permissions, and shared ownership
- Work happens across teams and tools
- “Edge cases” are frequent, not rare

## Practical strategies

### Design around jobs, not screens

Map the end-to-end job users are trying to complete and design for the full loop.

### Make state obvious

Surface: ownership, status, and next steps (especially in multi-step processes).

### Prefer progressive disclosure

Show the basics by default; reveal advanced options when needed.

## Common pitfalls

- Hiding critical actions behind advanced settings
- Overloading tables with too many columns
- Ignoring permissions until late (it reshapes the UX)
