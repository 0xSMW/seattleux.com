# Synthesizing qualitative research without losing rigor

## The problem

Synthesis can become “vibes-based” if you don’t track evidence. Good synthesis keeps a trail from quotes → observations → themes → implications.

## A practical synthesis workflow

1. **Standardize notes.** Use the same headings per participant.
2. **Extract observations.** Separate what happened from your interpretation.
3. **Cluster by meaning.** Group observations that point to the same underlying issue.
4. **Name themes carefully.** Prefer neutral names (“Unclear account status”) over solutions (“Add a dashboard”).
5. **Quantify appropriately.** Use “how many participants” as support, not as statistical proof.
6. **Convert themes into opportunities.** “Users can’t X because Y.”

## Outputs that drive action

- Top 5 themes with evidence
- Opportunities ranked by impact/risk
- “Decision-ready” recommendations (what we should do next and why)

## Common pitfalls

- Jumping to solutions during clustering.
- Losing minority/edge cases that represent high risk.
- Presenting quotes without implications.
