# Writing research plans that actually get approved

## The problem

Research gets blocked when stakeholders don’t see:

- what decision it will inform
- how long it will take
- what will change because of it

## A research plan that works

Keep it to 1–2 pages.

### 1) Decision + risks

- Decision we need to make:
- Risks if we’re wrong:

### 2) Research questions (not tasks)

- What do we need to learn to reduce risk?

### 3) Method + why

- Method:
- Why this method fits the decision:

### 4) Participants

- Who:
- How many:
- Recruitment plan:

### 5) Timeline

- Dates for: recruit, run sessions, synthesize, share out

### 6) Outputs

- Deliverables (e.g. themes, clips, prioritized opportunities)
- How the team will use them (workshop, backlog update, roadmap review)

## Common pitfalls

- “We’ll figure out questions later.”
- Choosing methods based on preference instead of decision.
- Promising outputs you can’t produce in the timeline.
