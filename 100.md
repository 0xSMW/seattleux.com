## Next 20 to execute

Refill this section after the current batch lands.
101. Adopt the `shadcn/ui` component library to deliver polished interactive controls; prioritize the top 10 primitives that keep the site feeling responsive and accessible:
    - `Button` variants (default, ghost, outline, link) for consistent primary+secondary actions.
    - `Card` containers for grouped showcase content (featured firms/guides/events).
    - `Tabs` or `Command`+`Tabs` combos to surface multiple data views without page reloads.
    - `Accordion` patterns for FAQ or condensed sections (filters, release notes).
    - `Dialog`/Modal for quick forms and informational prompts (newsletter, issue reports).
    - `DropdownMenu`/`ContextMenu` for compact filter/utility toolbars.
    - `Popover` for contextual tips or preview details on hover/focus.
    - `Tooltip` to clarify icon buttons or statuses in dense lists.
    - `Toast` for ephemeral confirmation/error messaging (form submissions, filters).
    - `ScrollArea` or `NavigationMenu` for browseable panes that need custom scrollbars on desktop.
